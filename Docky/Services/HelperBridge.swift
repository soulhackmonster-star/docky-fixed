//
//  HelperBridge.swift
//  Docky
//
//  XPC client for the optional Docky Helper. The helper is a separately
//  distributed Developer ID-signed agent that lives outside the App
//  Store sandbox and vends the private-API features Docky depends on
//  (SkyLight blur, AX window control, MediaRemote, system Dock
//  manipulation, etc).
//
//  Both bundles are signed with the same Team ID, so the helper's
//  XPC listener can verify the client is genuinely Docky via
//  `audit_token` + `SecCodeCheckValidity`, and the client can verify
//  the helper the same way. No HMAC handshake, no shared secrets.
//
//  Goal-shaping (per /goal):
//  - The full Developer ID product never asks the bridge anything,
//    its features call private APIs directly. The bridge exists only
//    so the MAS / sandboxed build can light up the same features
//    *when* the user has installed the helper.
//  - `isAvailable` gates every UI affordance for features that
//    require the helper. When `false`, the controls don't render at
//    all (clean optics: the user doesn't see disabled buttons or
//    "needs helper" CTAs unless they go looking for them).
//  - The MAS-only build (gated by `#if APP_STORE_SANDBOX`, added in
//    a follow-up commit) is the only consumer of this bridge today.
//    Until then it's harmless dead code with `isAvailable == false`.
//
//  Protocol versioning: the first call on every fresh connection is
//  `ping(reply:)` returning `"pong:vN"`. The bridge refuses to
//  expose `isAvailable = true` unless the helper's version matches
//  what this bundle was built against. Update + ship them in
//  lockstep when the protocol changes.
